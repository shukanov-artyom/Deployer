# Deployer

This project has been developed as a deployment tool for a production project. 
Was run on Atlassian Bamboo and just has been taken as a sample to my github portfolio.

Give this tool a file with your SVN diffs and a couple of console commands, and it will generate a deployment script which will upload your delta to a remote server using SSH. This small application was created to work on a CI system and was used for deployment to a dev environment on a real project. Includes unit tests.

Written on .NET Core (dotnetcoreapp1.1)
Unit tests based on on xUnit package.
